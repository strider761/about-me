         <p>Hello and welcome to my website, my name is Brent Runge. I have taken classes in C Programming, Java, Networking and Web Design, and 
            am proficient in the Microsoft Office suite, Netbeans IDE, Visual Studio 2017 and more. I first started at RVCC way back in 2008,
            and returned in 2016 to continue working towards my degree in Computer Programming.  I have four years experience selling, building, and repairing
            computers as well as helping customers find personal business solutions. <br><br>I am scheduled to graduate in Spring 2019.
